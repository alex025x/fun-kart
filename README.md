# Fun Kart - Go-Karting Lessons

As a former Go-Kart driver myself that still enjoys Go-Karting from time to time, I came up with the idea of creating a Website where people can sign up for Go-Karting lessons. Fun Kart is a contemporary platform dedicated to the exhilarating world of karting. This HTML and CSS-based website enables enthusiasts, whether novices or pros, to book karting lessons effortlessly. Dive into the world of karting with professional instructors and state-of-the-art facilities, all set to elevate your racing experience. Whether it's your first ride or your quest for championship glory, Fun Kart is your go-to digital pit stop for unforgettable karting adventures.

## Mobile-First Development Approach 

Fun Kart was developed using a mobile-first approach, ensuring that the website is fully optimized for mobile devices and smaller screens. As of course probably most users will sign up for the lessons using a mobile device, when the website is used from such device the navigation menu is opened by clicking the burger icon. As a result, the web application is responsive and user-friendly.
